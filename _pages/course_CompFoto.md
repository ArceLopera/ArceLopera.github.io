## Description

This course offers the basic elements for students to understand the impact of computers in traditional photography. 
Basic concepts of computer vision, computer graphics, image processing, mathematics, and optics are taught using project-based exercises.
Tools and algorithms for image acquisition, manipulation and sharing are discussed as means to foster creativity 
when implementing high-impact visual projects. This course is interdisciplinary and no previous knowledge is required.
