### Research Overview

<div style="text-align: justify"> 
The Sensory Perception Engineering Laboratory uses engineering measuring and modeling techniques to predict 
high-order cognitive processes. 
Its research includes developments in cognitive science, sensory perception, experimental psychology, 
machine learning, artificial sensing, product design, and consumer behavior. 

Current research explores the design, implementation, and evaluation of novel systems in the intersection 
of three main research fields: 
 <ul>
   <li>digital signal processing </li>
   <li>machine learning </li>
   <li>human perception</li>
 </ul>
 
His interdisciplinary research team regularly comprises a mix of 
undergraduates and graduate students, and he supervises students from the Telecommunication Engineering, 
the Software System Engineering, and the Interactive Media Design program.
