Monitoring biodiversity in tropical environments is a challenging task, 
especially in a long-term frame. Indeed, the technological tools for monitoring biodiversity 
are developed for other latitudes and environmental conditions. 
These tools are not well adapted to extreme conditions of humidity and temperature. 
Moreover, they are not designed for the particular conditions of diversity present in megadiverse countries 
such as Colombia. 
This research project seeks to build a monitoring tool capable of resisting tropical extreme conditions. 
The main idea is to develop an array of microphones to differentiate the species by triangulation of the sound 
sources present in the monitoring area.
