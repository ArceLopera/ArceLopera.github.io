Traffic accidents are the second cause of violent death in Colombia. 
One of the most prominent factors affecting driver behavior is stress. 
This project aims to develop a biometric interface using sensors built on open source hardware. 
The interface will be able to collect and analyze the data from the driver, 
and recognize the driver’s emotional state. Identifying different emotional states 
will allow real-time feedback to the driver, so he can take corrective actions on time, 
and avoid behaviors leading to a driving accident.
