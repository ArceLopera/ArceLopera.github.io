This project aims to develop wearable and biometric interfaces using sensors and actuators built on open source hardware. 
The interfaces will be able to collect and analyze data from the user interaction, 
and recognize user behavior, cognitive load or mental state. Identifying different user behavior and cognitive states 
will allow real-time feedback, so the user can take corrective actions on time, 
and avoid behaviors leading to dangerous situations, such as driving accidents.
