Traffic accidents are the second cause of violent death in Colombia. 
One of the most prominent factors affecting driver behavior is stress. 
This project aims to develop a biometric interface using sensors built on open source hardware. 
The interface will be able to collect and analyze the data from the driver, 
and recognize the driverâ€™s emotional state. Identifying different emotional states 
will allow real-time feedback to the driver, so he can take corrective actions on time, 
and avoid behaviors leading to a driving accident.
