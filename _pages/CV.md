### Executive Summary
<div style="text-align: justify"> 
Carlos Arce Lopera is a tenured Associate professor in the Faculty of Engineering at 
<a href="https://www.icesi.edu.co/">Universidad Icesi</a>. 
He leads the Sensory Perception Engineering Laboratory (SPE Lab) part of the i2T Research group at Universidad Icesi. 
The SPE Lab consolidates findings from basic human sensory perception into system and product design. 
His current research explores the design, implementation and evaluation of novel systems in the intersection 
of three main research fields: 
 <ul>
   <li>digital signal processing </li>
   <li>machine learning </li>
   <li>human perception</li>
 </ul>
His interdisciplinary research team regularly comprises a mix of 
undergraduates and graduate students, and he supervises students from the Telecommunication Engineering, 
the Software System Engineering and the Interactive Media Design program.
