Monitoring processes require specialized systems adapted to the specific environment where the technology has to be deployed into. 
For example, in tropical environments biodiversity monitoring tools are not well adapted to extreme conditions of humidity and temperature.  
This research project seeks to build technological systems capable of answering to the specific requirements of monitoring processes.
