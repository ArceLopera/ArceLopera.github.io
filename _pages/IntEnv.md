## About
Intelligent Environments, IE are spaces in which computation is seamlessly used to enhance ordinary activity. 
IE are both embedded and multimodal allowing people to interact with them in natural ways. 
Rather than making computer-interfaces for people, the idea is to build people-interfaces for computers.
