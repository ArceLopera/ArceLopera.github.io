Intelligent Environments use real environments in which computation is seamlessly used to enhance ordinary activity. 
These intelligent environments need for the development of interfaces that are both embedded and multimodal allowing people 
to interact with them in natural ways. This project aims for the design of new systems that react to natural interaction with humans. 
Mainly, these systems employ innovative usage of sensing technology. Then, the signals are analyzed using pattern recognition algorithms to classify agent behaviors. 
Finally, the system reacts accordingly giving a multimodal feedback that may initiate conversational interaction with the agent.
