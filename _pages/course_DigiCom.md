## Main Goals

- To explain the main architecture characteristics of a digital communications system (DCS). 
- To explain source and channel coding algorithms.
- To explain the transmission and reception process in DCS.
- To design and to simulate a DCS and measure its efficiency, quality, and data integrity.
