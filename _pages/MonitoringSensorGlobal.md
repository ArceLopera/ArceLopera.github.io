Monitoring processes require specialized systems adapted to the specific environment 
where the technology has to be deployed into. 
This research project seeks to build technological systems capable of answering to 
the specific requirements of monitoring processes.
Applications of the developments include:
1. Systems for Biodiversity Monitoring(/biodiversity/)
2. Systems for Consumer Behavior Monitoring ()
3. Technology for retail()
