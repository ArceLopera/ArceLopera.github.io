Visual information of the products offered by virtual channels has an important role in 
the customer purchase intention, for the case of perishable products, especially for  
vegetables, such  information  becomes  more  important  since  it  involves  one  of 
the  sensory  aspects that consumers use to decide whether or not to purchase. 
The principal goal of  this study is to identify and  characterize  different  types  
of   visual  information  that affect vegetable purchase intention through virtual 
channels  and  determining  the  technical  and  financial  requirements  that  a  
retail  company  should  consider  to  present this information using information 
technologies. Other factors that also affect online purchase intention are  included,  
and  although  unrelated  to  the  products  visual presentation, are tied to issues to be 
considered by organizations, so that the whole virtual buying process is satisfactory to the client.
