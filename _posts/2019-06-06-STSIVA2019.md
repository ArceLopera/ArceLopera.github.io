One of the tasks of the Music Information Retrieval area is the characterization of a musical genre. 
For this purpose, it is necessary to have a dataset of songs with enough information to perform the task. 
In order to know if there is enough information on the dataset, an analysis of the dataset is required. 
In this paper we perform an analysis of the Salsa dataset using unsupervised machine learning techniques 
and then extend it with annotations made by an expert.
