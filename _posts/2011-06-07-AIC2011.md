This study aims to determine the effect of light on the food appearance concerning its color,
glossiness, and visual texture. We conducted a sensory experiment on food appearance of dishes
under different light sources. We used the digital images of the 12 kinds of food dishes to give the
subject the same visual stimuli and no olfactory cues. As a result, there were strong correlations
between “visual taste” and “color appearance” in all foods. “Glossiness” could be contributing
factor to “visual taste” in some foods, whereas “visual texture” was little affected by the light
sources.
