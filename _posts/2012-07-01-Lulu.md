To investigate how humans visually perceive the quality of their
skin, we took photographs of the faces of 117 Japanese women.
Subsequently, we cropped a square patch around the right cheek
of every woman and presented to subjects that had to rate their
perceived visual quality. In Experiment 1, we found that the
perceived age was highly correlated with the number of wrinkles,
the glossiness perception and the quantity of colored spots,
whereas the visibility of pores and the color of the skin had low
correlation. Moreover, the age perception also was significantly
high correlated with image and sub-band statistics of
the luminance channel. In Experiment 2, we built artificial images
by using a histogram matching technique that modifies the
luminance distribution but keeps the color and pattern
information intact, and found that the modification of the
luminance statistics on the skin texture resulted in a correlated
modification in the perceived age and skin quality assessments.
