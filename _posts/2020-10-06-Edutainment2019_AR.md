User engagement and information understanding was assessed for a basic electronics tutorial 
designed using Augmented Reality (AR). The main idea was to compare user performance in collaborative 
environments between two different versions of the AR application: a desktop version and a mobile version. 
Preliminary testing of both versions revealed that users were interested in AR technology but did not 
intuitively understand how to better utilize the system in comparison with a static video. 
Moreover, in spite there was not a statistically significant difference between information 
understanding between both conditions, the mobile application was rated significantly lower than 
the desktop application in user engagement for collaborative environments.
