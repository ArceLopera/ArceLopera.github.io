In preschool environments, there is an increased use of in-class cognitive training games 
designed to enhance aspects of cognitive control, such as memory and attention. 
However, training design for preschoolers must prioritize collaborative behavior and 
engagement in their young inattentive players. A collaborative training game was 
designed to enhance selective sustained attention in four-year-old children. 
The experimental results showed that the collaborative intervention was highly 
engaging in comparison with an individual setting. 
However, further studies are needed to evaluate the influence of its regular 
usage for attention enhancement.
