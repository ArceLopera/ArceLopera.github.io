A set of onomatopoeic expressions for eating fruits and vegetables is compared across subjects whose 
native language is Spanish, French, or German. Subjects chose the onomatopoeia that best represented 
the sound of eating a fruit or vegetable (celery, banana, strawberry, passion fruit, mango, 
apple, orange, and tomato). Results show there are onomatopoeias that have a higher frequency of 
response in one language compared to the others. Thus, it is possible to assume that depending on the 
language there is a better way to express haptic and auditory information associated to fruit and vegetable 
consumption. Moreover, and considering the three languages, results show there are three categories of responses 
based on the relative strength of the material (strong and medium strength, and soft). Thus, there is some 
consistency in the onomatopoeias that represent the sound of eating a fruit or a vegetable. 
To conclude, results differ by language, but they are consistent within a category of sound.

Highlights
- Onomatopoeias can represent the sound and texture of eating a fruit or vegetable.

- Onomatopoeias that represent the idea of eating a fruit or vegetable are grouped by how soft or hard is the material.

- The best onomatopoetic expression for eating a fruit or vegetable differs by language (Spanish, German, or French).
