This data article includes the visual stimuli used to test the categorization of a set of soft drink 
bottle silhouettes. Additionally, subjectsâ€™ perceptual categorization was associated with each visual 
stimuli. The silhouette of the soft drink bottles was characterized by calculating the most common 
object shape measurements such as width, height and area and combining them with more complex and 
specific quantitative shape measurements such as the principal moment statistics. Finally, 
this data article includes the code for extracting these shape characteristics from image silhouettes.
