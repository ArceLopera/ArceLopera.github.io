To investigate how humans visually perceive the quality of their skin, we took photographs of the 
faces of four females with different ages in a controlled environment. The first experiment consisted 
in the random presentation of these photographs to subjects who had to rate their perceived quality in
 terms of perceived age. The results showed that the perceived skin quality is highly correlated with 
 the luminance distribution in that texture. In the second experiment, we presented artificially built 
 stimuli using a luminance matching technique that did not change the color information. The results 
 also corroborated that the skin quality perception changed concordantly with the changes in luminance 
 distribution.
