To investigate how humans visually perceive the quality of their skin, we took photographs of the faces of four females with different ages in a controlled environment. The first experiment consisted in the random presentation of these photographs to subjects who had to rate their perceived quality in terms of perceived age. The results showed that the perceived skin quality is highly correlated with the luminance distribution in that texture. In the second experiment, we presented artificially built stimuli using a luminance matching technique that did not change the color information. The results also corroborated that the skin quality perception changed concordantly with the changes in luminance distribution.
