Public Transportation Systems with robust information platforms allow their customers to access vehicle related information expecting that well-informed customers have a better riding experience or perceive waiting times shorter. Unfortunately that is not the case of users of urban transportation systems in large developing cities who often report poor user experience. We present the results of a user study of a visualization project that complements the information available to bus dispatchers at the control room with a graphic representation of the on-going customer experience. The aim of the project is to promptly support dispatcher’s response to unforeseen situations that undermine quality of service. From the evaluation of a visualization prototype we derive some design guidelines for the inclusion of the customer experience in the operation visualization displayed at the dispatcher’s control room.
