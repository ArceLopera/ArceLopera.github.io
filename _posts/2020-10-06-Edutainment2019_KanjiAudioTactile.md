Assistive technology in learning environments needs to foster information recall strategies as a 
primary advantage over traditional learning systems. Moreover, multi-modal priming can be used as 
a well-known strategy to reinforce integration and association of memory for different stimulus in 
different modalities. A game-based memory training was designed to aid the visual vocabulary acquisition 
of Japanese Kanji using audio and tactile stimuli priming. Preliminary results revealed that the 
memory training showed a statistically significant increase in information recall. However, further 
research is needed to validate if this type of priming strategy holds in long-term information recall.
