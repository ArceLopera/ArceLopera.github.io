Customer brand recognition is a critical factor in the retail environment. 
Here, we tested two prototypes with ambient technology and gamification elements 
in a store shelf display for enhancing customer brand recognition. 
The first prototype focused on showcasing the environmental labor of the company 
when the customer played a ball tossing game. The second prototype was a shelf 
display with a virtual reality experience based on the brand identity. 
Subjects tested both prototypes using a user engagement scale and results show 
that they were positively perceived in usability and enhance user engagement, 
brand recall and brand perception.
