Salsa is a well-known musical genre and part of our
cultural identity. Its origins date back to the 30s of
the last century and it has grown in popularity since
its origins. Ever since, by different artists in different
regions of the world have modified the genre, through
different visions of what salsa is, experimenting and
adding new instruments and technology. Thus, salsa
becomes an intrinsically complex and difficult genre
in qualitative terms. However, little we know at a
computational level, about which are the acoustic
characteristics defining this music, to make it different
from the rest of musical genres. In this paper we
show the results of a process that builds a knowledge
base of salsa music freely available to the scientific
community. This base gathers acoustic information
of over 20.000 salsa songs. We pretend to use this
information to model different characteristics of the
genre by means of AI techniques. In addition to making
information accessible to researchers interested in
salsa music, another important contribution of this
project is to provide tools to enlarge the knowledge
base with the help of the scientific community. To
achieve this, we developed a software that extracts
the pertinent acoustic information from songs
belonging to users and then it includes them into the
knowledge base.
