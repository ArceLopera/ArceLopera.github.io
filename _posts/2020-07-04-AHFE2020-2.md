Smart Cities require the deployment of sensing technology that periodically 
monitor the city resources, such as the road infrastructure. 
Indeed, road maintenance is considered a key element for city management. 
Here, we propose an in-vehicle optical monitoring system that classifies and 
monitors road conditions. The system consists of three main modules allowing 
road-condition sensing, geospatial localization, information storage and classification. 
The road-condition classification algorithm is not only capable of identifying potholes 
and bumps on the road but also of showing the degree of 
road damage to guide city authorities to design strategic road maintenance.
