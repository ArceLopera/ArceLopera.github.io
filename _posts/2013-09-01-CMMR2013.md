This paper describes the use of a timbre space mental model to control
a digital synthesizer. To create new sounds, our interface uses a morphing
technique with the synthesizerÂ´s presets. All presets are arranged in a bidimensional
space that can be continuously explored by a performer in real
time. To setup the interactive space, all preset sounds were analyzed using different
spectral and cepstral descriptors. A perception based approach was considered
for defining the interactive space. The space dimensions were selected
after performing different timbre discrimination experiments. Experiments were
aimed at maximizing the accuracy of the timbre space while controlling the
number descriptors used. Finally, we discuss how our interface is a step towards
customized exploration of sound synthesis.
