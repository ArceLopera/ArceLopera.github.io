Two research projects won the 2019 Humboldt Connection Prize awarded by the Goethe Institut. Both projects are 
part of a Biodiversity Monitoring Project aiming at the development of novel open source and low cost acoustic
monitoring adapted for the hardships of the tropical environments.
This recognition for [Monac](https://www.instagram.com/p/B1otYBihkaI/) and [BioViz](https://www.instagram.com/p/B1hKW4-lDri/)
showed that this research project has the potential to greatly impact conservation efforts.
