In our daily life, when we make quality discriminations such as deciding about freshness in fruits and
vegetables, we rely greatly on visual cues. However, it remains unknown on which visual information
this discrimination is based on. Here, we aim to find which visual cues affect our freshness perception.
We took as samples the freshness degradation process of cabbages and strawberries and tested their
freshness perception using psychophysical experiments. By digitally modifying the luminance histogram distribution of chromatic and achromatic images of both food textures, our results revealed the
effects of luminance and color on their freshness perception.
