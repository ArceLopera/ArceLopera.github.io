The authors describe the importance of music design for background instrumental music and the effect
on task performance. Three instrumental music conditions that differ in tempo, articulation, mode, and
musical meter were tested using a complex task scenario. The task was performed using a complicated
web-interface that required users to focus their attention and perform several specific interactions for
successfully finishing the task. All the interactions with the interface were recorded. Moreover, a mixed
assessment of the emotional state, perceived task performance, and music perception was asked to participants
upon task completion. Experimental results revealed that music design has complex effects on
task performance and emotion. Also, the results revealed important trends that can help design music
environments to control frustration when confronted to complex and cognitively demanding tasks.
