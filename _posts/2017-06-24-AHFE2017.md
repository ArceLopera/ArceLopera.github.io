We present an elastic interface designed to capture coarse and continuous movements that are characteristics 
of artistic, creative and performance processes. We tested our prototype and compared its performance with 
other two more traditional interfaces. Experimental results show that our interface is outperformed in simple tasks. 
However, for more complex scenarios, its performance is similar to the other interfaces both in response time 
and in precision error. The results suggest that our prototype is suitable for artistic composition and performance.
