In our daily life, we use our senses to acquire information about the objects that surround us. 
However, the information processing that allows for the recognition and consecutive classification 
of those objects into categories remains unclear. Our purpose is to analyze the categorization mechanism 
taking into account: (a) package visual metrics and (b) consumer perceptions of this basic visual information. 
First of all, we quantitatively analyzed the physical characteristics of 52 bottle silhouettes of seven 
soft drink categories: sports drinks, water, flavored water, sodas, fruit juices, malt drinks and tea. 
We found that measures of the shape of the bottles can model the membership to a product category. 
Our first experiment tested how accurately consumers could recognize product category from real bottle 
silhouettes. We found that the visual characteristics that differentiate product category silhouettes 
are lid width and bottle shape (body kurtosis). Our second experiment tested the capacity of consumers 
to recognize artificially created bottle silhouettes. When basic information, such as the product shape 
is modified, consumers are not always capable of recognizing its corresponding category. 
We concluded that the physical attributes of bottles are related to the categorization process of the bottle 
content made by consumers. These findings may provide guidelines for new bottle designs that capitalize on 
existing categorization rules based on consumer perception.
