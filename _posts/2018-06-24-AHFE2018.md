A wearable interface was designed, built and tested as a prototype to evaluate usersâ€™ engagement in a game setting. 
The wearable interface consisted of a light sensor and three different types of actuators: a RGB led, a buzzer 
and a vibe motor. Evaluations of the interface performance were conducted focusing on two main components: the 
multimodal feedback system and the involvement in game design over several rounds. Experimental results showed 
that our wearable interface is comfortable and imperceptible. Moreover, our wearable interface is simple enough 
for users to be able to add game modes based on social agreements. Our results demonstrate how meaningful 
multimodal feedback and self-directed involvement in game design can address several human factors challenges 
faced by user engagement designers.
