This data article includes the visual stimuli used to model the freshness perception of four different 
vegetable textures, namely a cabbage, a carrot, a strawberry and a spinach. All four vegetables were 
optically measured during their degradation process in a humidity, temperature and light controlled environment. 
The visual data is in csv format for convenient usage. Each data point represents a pixel value using the 
hardware independent XYZ color space. The total size of the data can be related to an equivalent image of 
1360x1024 resolution. Additionally, using the calibration data of an LCD-Display, the respective RGB color 
space images were derived from the XYZ data as an example. 
For interpretation and discussion, please see the original article entitled 
“Model of vegetable freshness perception using luminance cues”
