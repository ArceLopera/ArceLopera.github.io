This study aims to clarify the effect of the appearance of dishes
on the visual palatability for elderly people concerning its color
appearance, glossiness, and visual texture. We conducted a
subjective experiment on visual palatability of dishes under
different light sources. We used the digital images of 12 kinds of
food dishes to give the subject the same visual stimuli with no
olfactory cues. As a result, we found that elderly’s “visual
palatability” was affected by not only the “color appearance”
but also the “glossiness” of dishes.
