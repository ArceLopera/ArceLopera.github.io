Customer brand recognition is a critical factor in the retail environment. Here, we tested two prototypes with ambient technology and gamification elements in a store shelf display for enhancing customer brand recognition. The first prototype focused on showcasing the environmental labor of the company when the customer played a ball tossing game. The second prototype was a shelf display with a virtual reality experience based on the brand identity. Subjects tested both prototypes using a user engagement scale and results show that they were positively perceived in usability and enhance user engagement, brand recall and brand perception.
