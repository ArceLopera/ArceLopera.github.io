Face-to-face learning activities involve multiple acoustic interactions between 
students and teachers. These interactions provide information about their level 
of engagement with the educational activity. Hence, the acoustic interaction between 
the different actors in a classroom produces relevant information to evaluate their 
performance in a quantitative and qualitative manner. Traditionally, 
this information is collected through surveys and interviews. Technology is rarely 
used to record learning sessions due to the cost related to the installation of the 
equipment and the complexity of the analysis of the recordings. Here, we developed a 
web application that guided different types of student-teacher interaction during a class. 
The application recorded all the acoustic interactions and labeled the information so 
that subsequent analysis of the information can be efficiently processed.
