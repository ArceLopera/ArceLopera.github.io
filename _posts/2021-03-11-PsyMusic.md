Studies on the effect of music on task performance are contradictory about this relationship’s direction and valence. 
Task characteristics may be accounting for these inconclusive findings. Thus, this study employs effort to mediate 
music’s effect on task performance (objective and perceived) under a stressful decision-making process. 
This is a between-group experiment with three conditions: slow-tempo music, fast-tempo music, or no music. 
We designed a computer web interface, where participants did a stressful task. Results demonstrated that participants 
made a strong effort under the conditions with music. Hence, turning the music off under stressful activities is 
favorable in terms of performance. The article contributes to understanding 
the interaction between music and task performance, expanding the discussion within a stressful task.
