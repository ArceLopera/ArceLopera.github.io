Biodiversity monitoring through bioacoustics is gaining momentum as a way to promote conservation 
in highly biodiverse countries. However, in these regions, bioacoustic analysis is a complex task 
due to the diversity of overlapping sound sources coming to the recording microphones at the same time. 
Moreover, commonly, this highly subjective classification is performed manually by expert biologists 
trained for identifying different species by their particular sound. This cumbersome task is performed 
with non-specialized software. Here, we propose a visualization interface based on an interaction design 
process through a user-centered design philosophy.
