The purpose of this paper is evaluate to what extent consumers can recognise a scent within a context that is 
congruent either with the product or with the user, respectively, objects’ quality or subjects’ involvement.
This paper consists of two experimental studies. The first study assesses people’s capacity to recognise three 
scents: leather, synthetic leather, and fabric. The second study assesses the way in which a frame of reference 
(quality or involvement) affects people’s capacity for scent recognition (leather and fabric).
Results confirm the difficulty of scent recognition revealing, in the first study, a low level of consistency 
in subjects’ responses. The second study shows an interaction between the type of scent and consumers’ framework: 
subjects who are primed to think about product quality present more accurate scent recognition when they smell 
leather, whereas subjects who are primed to think about themselves present more accurate scent recognition when 
they smell fabric.
These results can be used in brand communication. A scent, such as that of leather, should highlight quality 
attributes in its communication. If the product is unscented, communication should highlight the subject who 
uses the product.
Previous studies show the importance of the consistency between scent and product marketing strategies. 
This study complements these findings by differentiating the context where a scent is presented considering either 
the product (the object’s quality attributes) or the individual who uses that product (subject’s involvement).
