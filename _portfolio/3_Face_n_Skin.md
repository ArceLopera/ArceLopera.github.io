Judging the visual appearance of the human skin involves a complex process made
by the human brain using the visual perceptual system. Recent research concerning the
appearance of human skin texture has been developed by multiple disciplines including
dermatology, neuroscience, and computer science. Some of these studies also
focused on quality assessments that search to understand the underlying processes of
human quality perception. Among them, human skin perception is an active research
field that investigates the classification and segmentation processes that take place when
we are confronted with human skin quality decisions such as age, attractiveness, or
health of a person. Indeed, when assessing health, physicians traditionally compare
perceived and chronological age. The appearance of "looking old for your age" is often
interpreted as an indicator of poor health. Moreover, the perceived age is believed
to be a better biomarker of skin and facial aging than chronological age. This project aims
at the development of image processing techniques that allow modeling skin quality perception
using common optical measuring systems.
