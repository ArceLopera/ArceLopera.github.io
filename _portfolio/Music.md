Music affects human behavior and induce different emotions on them. However, it remains unclear 
which variables of music design have greater impact on task performance and decision making. 
This research project aims to analyze different music 
design features and their respective induced emotional states and task performance on consumers. 
The results will reveal if there are significant features in music design that modify decision 
making depending on consumer profiles.
