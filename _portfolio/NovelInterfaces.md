This research area aims at the design and development of novel interfaces such as wearable, elastic, tactile, 
gesture-based, mobile, biometric and/or seamless interfaces between human and computers.
While prototype testing will focus on user engagement, the development of the interfaces will favor natural interaction 
with users by biometrical and/or behavioral pattern recognition using signal processing and analysis. 
This research area includes both hardware and software development. The applications include:
1. [Biodiversity Monitoring](/biodiversity/)
2. [Intelligent Environments (Retail, Tourism, Smart Cities)](/environ/)
3. [Wearable and Biometric Interfaces](/biometric/) 
4. [Education and Technology](/eduTech/)
