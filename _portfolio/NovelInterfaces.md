Novel Interfaces use real environments in which computation is seamlessly used to 
enhance ordinary activity. These intelligent environments need for the development
of interfaces that are both embedded and multimodal allowing people to interact 
with them in natural ways. This project aims for the design of new systems that 
react to natural interaction with humans. Mainly, these systems employ innovative
usage of sensing technology. Then, the signals are analyzed using pattern recognition 
algorithms to classify agent behaviors. Finally, the system reacts accordingly giving
a multimodal feedback that may initiate conversational interaction with the agent.
