This research project aims at the design and development of novel interfaces such as wearable, elastic, tactile and gesture-based interfaces. 
While prototype testing will focus on user engagement, the development of the interfaces will favor natural interaction 
with users by biometrical and behavioral pattern recognition using signal processing and analysis.
