This research project aims at the design and development of novel interfaces such as wearable, elastic, tactile and 
gesture-based interfaces. 
While prototype testing will focus on user engagement, the development of the interfaces will favor natural interaction 
with users by biometrical and/or behavioral pattern recognition using signal processing and analysis. 
This research theme includes both hardware and software development. The applications of the developments include:
1. Systems for [Biodiversity Monitoring](/biodiversity/)
2. Biometric User Behavior Monitoring 
3. Technology In Retail
4. Wearable and Gaming Interface Technology
