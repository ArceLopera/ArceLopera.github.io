Acoustic monitoring is an excellent technique used to
estimate biodiversity in areas with low visibility and high biodiversity,
such as the tropical forests. However, conventional audio recorders and
their components are expensive and not resistant for extreme
environments, such as the high humidity encountered in tropical
 environments.
