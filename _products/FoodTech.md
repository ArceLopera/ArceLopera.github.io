Food has some of the most common textures that we perceive on a daily basis. 
Understanding the human behavior when food quality is perceived can reveal the mechanisms 
that closely relate sensory processing to perceptual experience. Indeed, food quality perception 
is cross-modal and reflect complex associations among sensory modalities learned through experience. 

The purpose of the project is to model the effects of specific characteristics of sensory information on the 
perception of food quality. Research methodology will consist on employing carefully designed sensory stimuli 
and perform psychophysical experimentation to test the human ability to decide about the quality of food. 
The project will focus on visual information, such as luminance and color distribution, visual patterns, shape, 
shading and glossiness perception. 

The results of the project may allow to develop technology that could control food perception and eating behavior. 
Moreover, understanding consumer’s food choices and quality perception can have a direct impact on the design and 
display of food in the industry. Also, results may translate into understanding of fundamental visual perception 
mechanisms such as pattern and material recognition.
