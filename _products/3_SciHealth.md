### Bioacoustics
Monitoring bioacoustics in tropical environments is a challenging task, 
especially in a long-term frame. Typically, these tools are not well adapted to extreme 
conditions of humidity and temperature. 
Moreover, they are not designed for the particular conditions of diversity present in megadiverse countries 
such as Colombia. This research project seeks to build acoustic monitoring tools for tropical requirements 
and conditions.

### Biometric Monitoring
This research area aims at the design and development of novel interfaces such as wearable, elastic, tactile,
gesture-based, mobile, biometric and/or seamless interfaces between human and computers.
While prototype testing will focus on user engagement, the development of the interfaces will favor natural interaction
with users by biometrical and/or behavioral pattern recognition using signal processing and analysis.
This research area includes both hardware and software development.

### Facial and Skin Perception
Facial and skin perception is crucial for human interaction.
