I have lead design and development teams that tested novel interfaces for gaming and entertainment projects with
a variety of targeted audiences. From enticing real customers in retail environments [<sup>4</sup>](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3292147.3292186)
to enhancing attention of Pre-K students [<sup>1</sup>](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-030-50896-8_34), 
I focused on enhancing user engagement and interaction performance. Careful assessment of the quality of the user experience
coupled with the designing of novel hardware, I have developed multimodal systems that seek natural interaction 
with humans in real situations and games that serve as tools for training and evaluating user performance.
