Smart educational environments with innovative technology, such as XR experiences, seek
to enable students to immerse themselves in educational tasks with high engagement. When designing and developing
educational experiences using novel interfaces it is crucial to measure and enhance attention, memory, and/or engagement.
I have partnered with educators to develop technology-enhanced educational experiences that monitor teacher-student
interaction and enhance user performance and engagement.
