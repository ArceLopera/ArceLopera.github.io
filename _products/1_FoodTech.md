Food has some of the most common textures that we perceive on a daily basis. 
Understanding the human behavior when food quality is perceived can reveal the mechanisms 
that closely relate sensory processing to perceptual experience. Indeed, food quality perception 
is cross-modal and reflect complex associations among sensory modalities learned through experience. 

The purpose of the project is to develop systems that monitor the effects of specific characteristics of sensory 
information on the perception of food quality. Research methodology will consist on employing carefully designed 
sensory stimuli and perform psychophysical experimentation to test the human ability to decide about the quality of food. 
By developing technology that control food perception, designed systems may contribute to enhance favorable eating behavior 
and to understand consumer’s food choices which can have a direct impact on the design and display of food in the industry.
