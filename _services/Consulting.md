##Lifecycle - Understand and Plan 
Where and how to start? 
Before starting costly production activities, the validation of your needs and concepts is crucial.
In pre-production, my experience developing a wide range of projects can inspire your early design 
process. By analyzing your needs, competitors and target audience, a deeper understanding 
of the project objectives, scope and limitations can extract concise learnings to design a
project that responds to impactful criteria.

In a classical business understanding phase, the objectives and requirements are set using general
problem definitions and concepts. The foundational activities in this starting phase must be tested 
to avoid ill-defined objectives and biased hypothesis that do not take into account the user perspective or
the real environment. To test for valid and accurate definitions several tools exist to extract meaningful 
results and present them as simple insights. For example, a competitor analysis will analyze and dissect the 
details of your direct competitor's best practices and common failures. Also, concept testing using in-depth 
research provide summaries, ratings into usersâ€™ needs. 
Moreover, when needs are validated and objectives are clearly defined, decisions on which methodology is appropriate
considering the variety of project resources and limitations.
